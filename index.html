                <li>CSS stands for cascading stylesheet.</li>
                <li>CSS describes how html elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
                <li><b><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Css is not necessary</span> <span style="background:yellow;">Css saves lot of work.</span></b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
                <li style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</em></li>
            </ol>

        <h3><em>CSS can be added to html documents in 3 ways</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Inline - By using the style attribute inside html elements.</li>
            <li>Internal - By using the style element in head section.</li>
            <li>External - By using the link element to link an external css file.</li>
            <li>The most common to add css, is to keep the styles in external css files. However,
                <span style="background:yellow; font-weight: 900;">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier to you to try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>when comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that css class applies style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies style to unique element. ID is also special in that you can us especial URL to link directly to an element and
            its used by JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In css, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targated, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
        <p>There is wide range of selectors available. Two of the mainly used are class and ID. Both are used to target element to which styles should be applied.</p>
